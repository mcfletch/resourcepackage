<h1>ResourcePackage 1.0.0 for Python<br>
</h1>
<p>ResourcePackage is a mechanism for automatically managing
"resources"
(i.e. non-Python files: small images, documentation files, binary data)
embedded in Python modules (as Python source code), particularly for
those wishing to create re-usable Python packages which require their
own resource-sets. You can download it from the <a
 href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/resourcepackage/">project page</a>
on <a href="http://www.sourceforge.net/">SourceForge</a>.<br>
</p>
<p>ResourcePackage allows you to set up resource-specific sub-packages
within your package. It creates a Python module for each resource
placed in the resource package's directory during development. You can
set up these packages simply by copying an __init__.py file and then
use
the resources saved/updated in the package directory like so: <br>
</p>
<pre>from mypackage.resources import open_ico<br>result = myStringLoadingFunction( open_ico.data )<br></pre>
<p>ResourcePackage scans the package-directory on import to refresh
module contents, so simply saving an updated version of the file will
make it available the next time your application is run.<br>
</p>
<p>When you are ready to distribute your package, you need only replace
the copied __init__.py file with a dummy __init__.py to disable the
scanning support and eliminate all dependencies on resourcepackage
(that
is, your users do not need to have resourcepackage installed once this
is done).<br>
</p>
<p>Users of your packages do not need to do anything special when
creating their applications to give you access to your resources, as
they are simply Python packages/modules included in your package's
hierarchy. Your package's code (other than the mentioned __init__.py)
doesn't change.&nbsp; Similarly, automatic packaging systems will pick
up your resources as regular Python modules being imported by your
source-code.<br>
</p>
<p>There are two utility scripts, extract.py and scan.py which can be
used to manually extract or embed resources in a resourcepackage
package
even if the package no longer has a resourcepackage-aware __init__.py
file. &nbsp;See these scripts for usage details.</p>
<p class="technical"></p>
<p> ResourcePackage has been stable for many months now.&nbsp; There
is, at the moment, nothing more planned to be added or changed, as it
fulfills all of my needs for it.&nbsp; I am, of course, interested in <a
 href="mailto:mcfletch@users.sourceforge.net">suggestions</a> you might
have for improving the package.&nbsp; You can
get the distribution from the project page at:<a

<p>Happy Packaging!<br>
</p>
<h2>Usage Details</h2>
<p>During development:<br>
</p>
<ul>
  <li>copy scanning__init__.py to __init__.py in your resource directory</li>
  <li>[optionally] edit __init__.py to customise operation (examples):</li>
  <ul>
    <li>use resourcepackage.wxgenerators (or another generator package)
to provide special handling for particular file-types</li>
    <li>set the "force" flag to always reload resources into their
corresponding modules<br>
    </li>
  </ul>
  <li>save your resources to the resource directory<br>
  </li>
  <ul>
    <li>on (re-)import of __init__.py, it will scan your resource
directory and update resource files with dates newer than their
corresponding python module</li>
  </ul>
  <li>import your resources as Python modules and access their binary
content as package.module.data</li>
  <ul>
    <li>name will be the name of the file (with extension) with spaces,
'.' and '-' characters converted to '_' characters.</li>
  </ul>
</ul>
<p class="technical">Note: in version 1.0.0a2 and earlier, module names
dropped the file extension and lowercased the entire module name.
&nbsp;In 1.0.0a3 and forward neither of these transformations is
performed. &nbsp;As a result, "Index.html" will be show up in the
module
Index_html, instead of index in all newer version. &nbsp;Also as a
result, Index.html and index.html will be recognised as the same name
on case-ignoring filesystems, but if you've already got the source
files
on a case-ignoring system, they can't both exist :) .</p>
<p>When wanting to distribute your package:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Replace __init__.py with your run-time __init__.py (which can
just be an empty Python module, as with any Python package, which
doesn't need to know anything about ResourcePackage). &nbsp;</li>
</ul>
<p class="technical">That eliminates all connections to ResourcePackage
and you now have a regular Python package with all of your resources
embedded in it's modules. &nbsp;This isn't technically necessary, but
it
will make the installation cleaner and more efficient for users of your
package.<br>
</p>
<h2>Reference Documentation</h2>
<p>Pydoc <a href="pydoc/resourcepackage.html">documentation</a> is
available online for those wishing to browse it.<br>
</p>
<h2>Changes</h2>
<p>There have been a few changes in ResourcePackage during the
development period. &nbsp;In particular:<br>
</p>
<ul>
  <li>version 1.0.0 adds a few Unix #! lines to the extract and scan
scripts.<br>
  </li>
  <li>version 1.0.0b1 introduces an encoding comment at the top of
generated files.&nbsp; This avoids a spurious warning from Python 2.3b2
and above indicating that non-ASCII characters are being included in a
string.<br>
  </li>
  <li>version 1.0.0a3 had some significant incompatible changes from
version 1.0.0a2. &nbsp;If you downloaded ResourcePackage before
1.0.0a3,
you should expect some significant breakage, as the naming scheme for
modules, as well as the mechanisms for use in scanning__init__.py
changed significantly. &nbsp;See readme.txt in the source archive for
details.</li>
